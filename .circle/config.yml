orbs:
  # The Node.js orb contains a set of prepackaged CircleCI configuration you can utilize
  # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
  # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/node
  node: circleci/node@5
  

jobs:
  build_image: # this can be any name you choose
    executor: node/default # use the default executor defined within the orb
    steps:
      - checkout
      - node/install-packages:
          pkg-manager: npm      
      - run:
          command: npm run build

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
  build_deploy: #name i chose for workflow
    jobs:
      - build_image
     
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally instead use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the manually defined "test" job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
